        Some of our web pages use "cookies" so that we can better serve you with
        customized information when you return to our site. Cookies are
        identifiers which websites send to the browser on your computer to

      <p>
        With specific reference to third party advertising, we use third-party
        service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and
        sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about
        your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and
        services. They may also use information about your visits to this and
        other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This
        anonymous information is collected through the use of a 'pixel tag',
        which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No
        personally identifiable information is collected or used in this
        process. Such third parties do not know your name, phone number,
        address, email address, or any personally identifying information. If
        you would like more information about this practice and to know your
        choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third
        party service provider, with specific reference to booking/e-commerce
        transactions, CholoZai collects the following personal sensitive
        information from you while transacting through CholoZai, this includes
        your Name and Sex, Phone Number, Billing Address, Credit Card details
        and Date of birth in case of a child.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        CholoZai does not sell or trade upon any of the above foregoing
        information without the consent of the user or customer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The foregoing information collected from the users/customers/travelers
        is put to the following use:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Customer name, address, phone number, traveler's name, age and image of
        Passport are shared with applicable service providers like the airlines,
        hotels, etc., for the purpose of reservation and booking the services
        for the customer/traveler. Information like Credit Card Details and Net
        Banking Details are usually collected directly by the payment gateways
        and banks and not by CholoZai, but if ever stored or retained by us, the
        data will be stored internally, secured and is never shared, except that
        they may be shared with third party private/government security agencies
        to screen for fraudulent activities. These details are also shared with
        certain third parties only for the purpose of processing 'Cash Back
        &amp; Discounts'. Information like Phone number, E-mail address and
        billing address may be used for promotional purposes, unless the
        customer/user has unsubscribed from such services. Uploading a profile
        photo is optional and CholoZai doesn't use or share it for any purpose.
      </p>
